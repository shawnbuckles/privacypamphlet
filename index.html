                    <p>Humans create the tools that bring us civilization, that enlighten us, that connect and divides us. That undermines us.</p>
                    <p>Our freedom is at stake. I'll explain myself.</p>

                    <p>Our right to privacy is at stake. Privacy is the right to live unobserved and undisturbed, and to decide for oneself what information one shares and with whom. Privacy is based upon a personal enviroment in which we can seclude ourselves. Privacy is essential in shaping one's identity. It enables us to make autonomous choices. Not freedom of speech but privacy is our right to freedom. Because, what’s the use of speaking our minds when we’re not able to make up our minds in the first place?</p>
                    <p>But privacy is gone. We gave it up, for no other reason but the thought that it's useless. Why don't we protect our rights? Our ancestors fought fiercely for them -because they were oppressed.
                    <p>We are children of peace. We have lived in peace for almost three generations now. Because of that I reckon two things. One: peace is self-evident. Two: I don't need my privacy.</p>
                    <p>I will disprove both statements.</p>
                    <blockquote>I've got nothing to hide</blockquote>
                    <p>This is a fallacy. What will happen if Hitler takes power tomorrow? Nobody'd be safe. He wouldn't only know our location, networks and believes, also he could pretty accurately predict our behavioural patterns and our patterns of resistance. To flee or hide would be impossible. We'd be powerless. Wheter we have something to hide is defined by the context in which we live.</p>
                    <p>Their will come a day we need the right to privacy. Maybe that day's today. Are we free? Do we live in peace?<br />
                    That depends on who you regard as your friend. And more importantely: how your friends regard you.
                    <blockquote>The police state is completed</blockquote>
                    <p>For many years now, governments around the world seem to prepare for war. They mobilise their policeforces. The internal security market has growed exponentially. Borders have been closed. But who are they at war with?</p>
                    <p>Sometime ago, I've read a document that spoke of silent weapons for quiet wars. This document presumes that the Western elite gathered in 1954, and declared war to us: the people. Their mission was -so it states- the oppression of the people by gathering and analysing massive amounts of data. The elite seemed to realize the power of knowledge. Their goal was to secure their wealth and power by manipulating our patterns of behaviour. They knew that one day people will realize that a global (technological) utopia is possible. Today's the day.</p>

                    <p>Technology is an absolute entity. Politicians cannot control it. Companies have no power over it. Currently it's being used to control and condition us. It numbs us, entertains us, distracts us. It addicts us. It dictates its own pace. We should not conform to its rythm. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? Break with your apathy! Stand up for your rights. Don't you want to be free?</p>
